# Flappy-Bird-Clone-Build-Only

* This only has the build of the game. For the complete project, visit https://github.com/AnthonyQR/Flappy-Bird-Clone

Trying to improve my skills by recreating some games. Game works.

Features:

Jumping
Pipe generation
Score Tracker
Sound effects & animations
Dying & Quiting
Only issue is I can't switch between the game screen and the main menu freely. Can't be bothered to fix it though lol
